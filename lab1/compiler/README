As of L1, we are currently making use of
the following packages:

base, filepath, mtl, process, bytestring, syb, containers, 
pretty, transformers, fgl, directory, vector

All algorithms are essentially identical to those discussed in class, bar some slight modifications
for convenience.
Most of the design ideas were not ready in time to be used for L1, so most of the code is in the structure
of the starer code. This will change.

The main design idea we have implemented already is that all Assembly types
define their own version of used and defined predicates, and in the future we will depend only on 
those and other predicates.

Currently, the liveness analysis can have a stack overflow on large enough
programs, as it is using the built in List type. A port to a more efficient data structure
is in progress, but was not ready in time for today's handin.
